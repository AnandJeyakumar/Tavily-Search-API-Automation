      "content": "In classification, the machine learning model takes in data and predicts the most likely category, class or label it belongs to based on its values. We will discuss the theory behind these two prominent techniques alongside explaining many other key concepts like gradient descent algorithm, overfit and underfit, error analysis, regularization, hyperparameters and cross-validation techniques involved in machine learning. In the gradient descent algorithm, we start with random model parameters and calculate the error for each learning iteration, keep updating the model parameters to move closer to the values that results in minimum cost. Regularization can be applied to both linear and logistic regression by adding a penalty term to the error function in order to discourage the coefficients or weights from reaching large values.
