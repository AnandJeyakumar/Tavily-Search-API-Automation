      "content": "Since taking office, Trump has installed loyalists who follow his orders into key positions at the Department of Justice, issued executive orders centralizing decision-making within the White House, attempted to unilaterally change state and local election laws, demanded unprecedented access to voter data, dismantled election security protections, threatened elections officials and workers, law firms and others who have historically stood up to protect elections and defended, hired or pardoned those involved in previous efforts to subvert elections. On March 25, Trump issued a sweeping executive order aiming to allow the president to directly set state election law, despite the president having almost no constitutional role or legal power in the administration of elections.",

Greg Abbott had a message Sunday for the dozens of Democratic legislators who fled the state to derail a mega-partisan gerrymander: \u201cThis truancy ends now.\u201d However, if the absentee Democratic lawmakers remained in Texas, Abbott could order state troopers to haul them to the Capitol. State law permits a Texas district court to determine whether a public official has \u201cabandoned\u201d his or her office, declaring it vacant \u2014 enabling the governor to set new elections to fill the empty seats. And even if Abbott and Paxton win a clean sweep in removing the Democrats from office, it would then require a time-intensive process of calling special elections to fill the vacancies \u2014 and guaranteeing that the winners of those elections also remain in the state as well.",
