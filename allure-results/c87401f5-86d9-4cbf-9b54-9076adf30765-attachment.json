Jules Rimet was the president of FIFA from 1921 to 1954. Rimet was appreciated so much for bringing the idea of FIFA to life that in 1946 the trophy was named the Jules Rimet Cup instead of the World Cup Trophy. [1] The inaugural edition, held in 1930, was contested as a final tournament of only thirteen teams invited by the organization.",
