The Python language has several use cases in application development, including the following examples: Developers also use a wide range of Python frameworks that provide all the necessary tools to build web applications faster and more easily. In addition, more than 137,000 Python libraries are available for various applications, including web development, data science, and machine learning (ML). Developers can use Python frameworks to build Python applications more quickly because they do not have to worry about low-level details such as how communications happen in the web application or how Python will make the program faster.",
