This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market. How DevOps Works Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer \u201csiloed.\u201d Sometimes, these two teams are merged into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle, from development and test to deployment to operations, and develop a range of skills not limited to a single function. These teams use practices to automate processes that historically have been manual and slow.",

Because Scrum \"Scrum (software development)\") emerged as the dominant Agile framework in the early 2000s and it omitted the engineering practices that were part of many Agile teams, the movement to automate operations and infrastructure functions splintered from Agile and expanded into what has become modern DevOps. Today, DevOps focuses on the deployment of developed software, whether it is developed using Agile oriented methodologies or other methodologies.",

A DevOps team includes developers and IT operations working collaboratively throughout the product lifecycle, in order to increase the speed and quality of software deployment. A DevOps toolchain helps teams tackle important DevOps fundamentals including continuous integration, continuous delivery, automation, and collaboration. When security teams adopt a DevOps approach, security is an active and integrated part of the development process. Automation is one of the most important DevOps practices because it enables teams to move much more quickly through the process of developing and deploying high-quality software.
